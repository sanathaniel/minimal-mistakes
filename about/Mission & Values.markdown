<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>The Modernist Studies Association is devoted to the study of the arts in their social, political, cultural, and intellectual contexts from the later nineteenth through the mid-twentieth century. The organization aims to develop an international and interdisciplinary forum to promote exchange among scholars in this vital and rapidly changing field.</p>
<h3>Values</h3>
<p>The MSA supports the professional development of its members and the ongoing work of the field through free inquiry, critical examination, the sharing of multiple and varied scholarly perspectives, and a commitment to access, inclusion, diversity, and equity. The MSA values collaboration, cross-disciplinary connection, and openness, and it aspires to create spaces hospitable to the diverse intellectual and professional interests of its members. As a future-facing organization, we are committed to interrogating and dismantling the ways in which social, political, and historic inequalities—colonialism, segregation, fascism, homophobia, etc.—continue to shape our field. The MSA is dedicated to making modernist studies more welcoming and fostering belonging for all scholars and students of modernity. </p>
<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>This Code of Conduct applies to all forms of participation in the MSA community, including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
	<li> messages sent via MSA communication channels, both internal (e.g., listservs, email, instant messaging, Slack) and external (e.g., social media);</li>
	<li> participation in MSA governance and the administrative workings of the organization;</li>
	<li> participation in virtual and in-person events convened by MSA, including formal and informal gatherings taking place during the annual conference (seminars, workshops, panels, receptions, etc.), virtual and off-site conference events such as graduate student or Special Interest Group meet-ups, etc.</li>                                
</ul>

<p>The MSA calls upon its members to support these values in judgment and in action in order for the MSA to fulfill its mission and enact its values of free inquiry, collaboration, openness, access, and equity. We expect that all members have the opportunity to reap the full benefits of belonging, and MSA members are expected to participate in the work of the organization with integrity and the highest standards of professionalism.</p>
<p>In particular, MSA members should not:</p>

<ul>
	<li>exploit or discriminate against others on grounds such as race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, religion (or lack thereof), or other group identity.</li>
	<li>be sexually inappropriate in language or gestures of unwarranted intimacy or unwelcome advances, or sexually harass anyone they come into professional contact with, including students, colleagues, exhibitors, and staff members at partner institutions, hospitality, and conference sites, or anywhere associated with the MSA and its programs.</li>
	<li>use language that is prejudicial or gratuitously derogatory with regard to citation, analysis, commentary, discussion, or visual communication (such as screen shots or other projections), including racist, transphobic, homophobic, ableist, sexist, and other slurs. It is the responsibility of each member to abide by best practices in adopting inclusive language, such as <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A4TEdDgYslX-hlKezLodMIM71My3KTN0zxRv0IQTOQs/mobilebasic">“Writing About Slavery/Teaching About Slavery: This Might Help”</a> and the Modern Language Association’s <a href="https://mlahandbookplus.org/books/book/5/chapter-abstract/57053/Principles-of-Inclusive-Language?redirectedFrom=fulltext">“Principles of Inclusive Language.”</a></li> 
	<li>make prejudicial or arbitrary judgments (e.g., in evaluating conference proposals or grant applications) that might unfairly affect the academic freedom or professional development of anyone with whom they work. </li>
	<li>fail to disclose conflicts of interest (personal, professional, and commercial) as they relate to MSA programs and competitions.</li>
	<li>practice deceit or fraud on the academic community or the public, including plagiarizing the work of others in written or spoken discourse.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reporting Violations</h3>
<ul>
	<li>In interactions you have through your involvement with MSA, if you think there has been a violation of the Code of Conduct, please contact the President of the MSA; alternatively, if you are a member of the Contingent Faculty or Graduate Student Caucus, please contact your Representative on the MSA Executive Committee. The MSA takes infractions of the Code of Conduct extremely seriously, and will do our utmost to maintain confidentiality.</li>
	<li>In consultation with the Presidential Chain or the Executive Committee, based upon the kind of infraction involved, the President will consider whether a violation of the Code of Conduct has occurred. They will then determine the appropriate consequences, or sanctions, such as suspension of member privileges (e.g., organizing seminars, chairing panels, or attending the annual conference and related online events), up to and including termination of membership.</li>
	<li>If someone is found in violation of the Code of Conduct of one of MSA’s affiliate organizations, then sanctions issued by another organization may also extend to MSA participation. We will take into consideration the process and judgment of the MSA’s affiliate organizations. </li>
</ul>
<p><i>The MSA Code of Conduct was drafted by the Code of Conduct Subcommittee 2/2/21; and approved by the Executive Committee in 2/21; it was reviewed and revised 2/18/21 and 1/11/24. It is lightly adapted from the Code of Conduct prepared by the Council of Editors of Learned Journals with grateful acknowledgment.</i></p>
